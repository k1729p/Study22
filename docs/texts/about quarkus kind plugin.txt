For the creation of the 'kind.yaml' file it was used 'quarkus-kind' plugin in 'pom.xml':

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-kind</artifactId>
    </dependency>

The successful Maven build with this plugin requires
the file 'kind.exe' to be present in the working directory.

In actual 'pom.xml' this plugin is not used and
the file '...\target\kubernetes\kind.yaml' is not created.
